<P>Staatliches is a clean cut display face with charmingly unconventional proportions. The alphabet was designed by Brian LaRossa and Erica Carras, with production support from Eli Heuer, in response to Herbert Bayerâ€™s title lettering on the cover of the first Bauhaus exhibition catalogue which was published in 1923. It features full sets of capitals, numbers, punctuation, and symbols, in addition to alternate widths, discretionary ligatures, and common Latin accents.</p>
